Syslog Log Monitoring Script

This Python script is designed to monitor and display real-time logs from a syslog server. It captures crucial network events such as interface status (up/down), port channel changes, and configuration saves from Juniper and Cisco devices. The script parses the logs, filters for relevant events, and displays them in a readable format. It provides network administrators with a powerful tool for tracking and troubleshooting network issues in real time, ensuring operational stability and faster response times.
